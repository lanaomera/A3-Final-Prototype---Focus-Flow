- My Protoype is called Focus Flow, a musical composition coding prototype that generates personalized study music through EarSketch. 
- Unlike a static Spotify playlist, my prototype uses your own mood, your current stress levels or overall vibe to 
  create the perfect music for you. A simple user interface = mimimal distraction
